# About Me

Not sure why you'd want to be here, but since you are, I may as well introduce myself...

I'm Kyle, but you knew that already. Anyway, in terms of doing, this is who I am to most of the world VVV

To everyone else, well I'm just Kyle (O_O)

If you were expecting personal details then I'm sorry, but you won't find those here (x_x)

What you can find, however, is whatever cool sh*t I've pushed to my repos by the time you're here!

Why are you still here? Go check them out!

...

You're still here? Okay uh, bit unexpected, but sure I guess I can try to keep you busy (-_-)

How about a game of exes and ohs! I'll be Os!

```
___ | ___ | ___
___ | _O_ | ___
    |     |
```

Okay your turn!

...

Oh, right... You can't play along (._.)...

Okay how about I just leave you with some nice ascii art to look, curtousy of me? Great!
